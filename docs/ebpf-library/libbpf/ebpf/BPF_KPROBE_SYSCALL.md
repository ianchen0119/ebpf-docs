[:octicons-tag-24: v0.7.0](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

The `BPF_KPROBE_SYSCALL` macro is the original name of [`BPF_KSYSCALL`](BPF_KSYSCALL.md). As of [:octicons-tag-24: v1.0.0](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/releases/tag/v1.0.0) it is an alias to [`BPF_KSYSCALL`](BPF_KSYSCALL.md) for backwards compatibility.
